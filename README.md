# Statistical_Learning_On_MNIST_DataSet
Extracted two features, average brightness and average variance for each image from MNIST dataset. Estimated parameters for the 2D distribution for each label in training set and Implemented a 2D naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers which were able to predict the labels of testing set with an accuracy of 97%.
